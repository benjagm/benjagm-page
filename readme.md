# benjagm-page

This repository contains the source code for my personal website — a space to share who I am, what I’m working on, and what I’m learning along the way.

## About

This page is a living snapshot of my personal and professional journey.  
It’s a place where I collect projects, ideas, and reflections that represent what I value and how I think.

## Purpose

- To have a single place where I can point people who want to know more about me  
- To document the projects and topics I care about  
- To build something personal, authentic, and evolving over time
