# Migrating to Gradfolio Theme

## Overview

Gradfolio is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed for personal websites and portfolios. Based on the [official Gradfolio theme page](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/gradfolio/), this theme offers:

- **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
- **Dark Mode Support** - Automatically respects user preferences
- **Projects Showcase** - Dedicated section for your work
- **Research Profiles** - Easy linking to ResearchGate and ORCID

## Current Status

I've updated your current repository to be more compatible with Gradfolio's structure:

✅ Updated `_config.yml` with Gradfolio-compatible settings
✅ Restructured `index.md` with better content organization
✅ Created `Gemfile` for GitHub Pages compatibility
✅ Set up projects collection structure
✅ Added sample project file

## Next Steps

Since Gradfolio is designed to be used as a GitHub template, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use Gradfolio Template (Recommended)

1. **Create New Repository from Template:**
   - Go to the [Gradfolio GitHub repository](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio)
   - Click "Use this template" button
   - Create a new repository (e.g., `benjagm-gradfolio`)

2. **Migrate Your Content:**
   - Copy your personal information from the current `index.md`
   - Update the `_config.yml` with your details
   - Add your projects to the `_projects/` folder

3. **Update GitHub Pages:**
   - Enable GitHub Pages for your new repository
   - Your site will be available at `https://benjagm.github.io/benjagm-gradfolio/`

### Option 2: Continue with Current Setup

Your current setup is now optimized for a portfolio-style Jekyll site with:
- Better content structure
- Projects collection support
- GitHub Pages compatibility
- Responsive design capabilities

## Current Configuration

Your `_config.yml` now includes:
- Social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)
- Projects collection setup
- SEO optimization plugins
- GitHub Pages compatibility

## Files Created/Modified

- `_config.yml` - Updated with Gradfolio-compatible settings
- `index.md` - Restructured with better content organization
- `Gemfile` - Added for proper dependency management
- `_projects/sample-project.md` - Example project structure
- `GRADFOLIO_MIGRATION.md` - This migration guide

## Recommendation

For the best Gradfolio experience, I recommend **Option 1** - creating a new repository from the Gradfolio template and migrating your content. This will give you:

- Full access to all Gradfolio features
- Proper theme styling and layout
- Dark mode support
- Optimized project showcase

Would you like me to help you with either approach?
